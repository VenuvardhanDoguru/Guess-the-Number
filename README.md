Developed a classic Guess the Number Game in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enabling players to guess the
number from 1 to 100, which is randomly chosen by the system

The system will give hints when we enter a wrong number, indicating whether it is less or greater than our
entered number.

Implemented game mechanics for the Guess the Number Game, including number guessing, hint giving, and
win condition checking, resulting in an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
